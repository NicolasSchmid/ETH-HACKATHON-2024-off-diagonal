A is a constant which must be bigger than the maximum duration. Here we have added M + 1 new qubits to perform this calculation. To understand where this hamiltonian comes from nd hw these additional qubits help we look at an example of a set of tasks which respect the boundary condition and one which doesn't. \n",

    "If $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}d_i b_i \\leq d_{max}$ then there exist a binary encoding with M bits $(y_0, y_1, ... y_{M-1},y_M)$ where the binary values $y_j$ for $j \\in \\{1, M-1\\}$ add the respective power of two $2^j$, not here that the maximum total duration we can encode with these first M qubits is $2^M-1$. Remembering that $M = \\lfloor\\log_2(d_{\\text{max}})\\rfloor$ we can conclude that $2^M \\leq c \\leq 2^{M+1}$ therefore the $y_M$ bit must be multiplied with the difference between $c$ and $2^M - 1$.

If the condition is not met there will never be such a pseudo-binary encoding $(y_0, y_1, ... y_{M-1},y_M)$ that matches the resulting total duration. Therefore $H_A$ will not be zero and these states are punished quadratically for their overshooting.   \n",

Considering the fact that we will only be able to aply at most two qubit gates we an take the taylor expansion of this exponential up to second order. Finally one can then play around with the parameters of the linear and quadratic term to create an unbalenced cost function. We want to produce a positiv signed parabola which induces small cost for states with $D \\approx 0$ so that we don't favor solutions which don't fully uses the maximal duration condition.
